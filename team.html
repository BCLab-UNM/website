							We live in a complex world. From the spread of disease in increasingly interconnected human
							populations to the impact of fossil-fueled economies on global climate, the greatest challenges in
							modern science and engineering require understanding complex systems, what makes them efficient and
							resilient, and why they fail. My lab studies complex biological systems including the adaptive
							immune system and ant colonies. I use this understanding to design efficient, robust, adaptive and
							scalable engineered systems, including autonomous robots that mimic ant behaviors to collect
							resources cooperatively.

							VolCAN requires the coordination of distributed robot swarms to successfully search in large
							hazardous regions. My work falls into three related categories: distributed biological processes
							(e.g. chemical reaction networks, immunological and social-insect search processes, and neural
							networks), parallel supercomputing, and algorithms for robot swarms. Robots can explore areas too
							dangerous for humans and therefore help to answer basic scientific questions. In the VolCAN project,
							we designed and built aerial robots and algorithms to sample gasses from volcanos. This data
							contributes to our understanding of climate change, the prediction of eruptions, and how best to
							coordinate teams of robot scientists in general.

							Lab. Working with the earth and planetary sciences department, John's research focus is on
							autonomous airborne robot swarms used to sample volcanic C0<sub>2</sub> plumes. The goal of this is to link
							volcanic C0<sub>2</sub> output with volcanic behavior to better understand the precursors to life-threatening
							eruptions. John has also published on a variety of other research topics including software
							architecture, evolutionary complex systems, and intelligent swarm robotics.

							Carter is a transfer student from Santa Cruz, California he is just starting his second semester
							here at UNM. For over 10 years he worked in cybersecurity working on private key infrastructure
							like national ID systems, Certificate management and private key storage systems called HSMs.
							So he worked on systems that establish and maintain trust. He has been teaching at Cabrillo
							College/PVUSD engineering camps well over the 7 years, as well as teaching as a supplemental
							instructor at Cabrillo College. Carter got into robotics ~5 years ago initially through his local
							community college in California (Cabrillo College's) Robotics club. He worked remotely with UNM's
							Moses Biological Computation Lab on various projects like with NASA's Houston space center on a new
							class of rovers for the Moon & Project chili house. He has made the move out out to Albuquerque and
							is now working on UNM's VolCAN team as well as working on Swarmathon TNG.

							Ellie Larence is an undergraduate at the University of New Mexico (UNM). She has a bachelor’s degree in biology and worked as a molecular biologist at the New Mexico Department of Health before returning to UNM to study computer science. Previous research projects Ellie has worked on include characterizing morphological variation in American marten and evaluating the performance of deep learning models. Currently, she is working with Dr. Melanie Moses to develop an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, using supercomputing resources to simulate the effects of the innate immune response on viral infections. She is also an active member of UNM’s supercomputing team, participating in national competitions building, running, profiling, and optimizing HPC applications on multiple computing systems. Ellie is broadly interested in applying computational techniques to challenging biomedical research questions and is particularly excited by machine learning applications to genomic data. She plans to pursue a Ph.D. focusing on problems in computational genomics.

						I am Akil Andrews a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UNM. My research interest's are in artificial intelligence, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, artificial life, and computational science. My goal is to research algorithms that mimic life. I also enjoy following research in particle physics, classical and quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology. My personal belief is that technology will one day answer the origin and meaning of life. After graduation with my Doctoral degree, I plan to join research efforts in pursuit of the answer.
