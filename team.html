							We live in a complex world. From the spread of disease in increasingly interconnected human
							populations to the impact of fossil-fueled economies on global climate, the greatest challenges in
							modern science and engineering require understanding complex systems, what makes them efficient and
							resilient, and why they fail. My lab studies complex biological systems including the adaptive
							immune system and ant colonies. I use this understanding to design efficient, robust, adaptive and
							scalable engineered systems, including autonomous robots that mimic ant behaviors to collect
							resources cooperatively.

							VolCAN requires the coordination of distributed robot swarms to successfully search in large
							hazardous regions. My work falls into three related categories: distributed biological processes
							(e.g. chemical reaction networks, immunological and social-insect search processes, and neural
							networks), parallel supercomputing, and algorithms for robot swarms. Robots can explore areas too
							dangerous for humans and therefore help to answer basic scientific questions. In the VolCAN project,
							we designed and built aerial robots and algorithms to sample gasses from volcanos. This data
							contributes to our understanding of climate change, the prediction of eruptions, and how best to
							coordinate teams of robot scientists in general.

She has a bachelor’s degree in biology and worked as a molecular biologist at the New Mexico Department of Health before returning to UNM to study computer science. Previous research projects Ellie has worked on include characterizing morphological variation in American marten and evaluating the performance of deep learning models. Currently, she is working with Dr. Melanie Moses to develop an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, using supercomputing resources to simulate the effects of the innate immune response on viral infections. She is also an active member of UNM’s supercomputing team, participating in national competitions building, running, profiling, and optimizing HPC applications on multiple computing systems. Ellie is broadly interested in applying computational techniques to challenging biomedical research questions and is particularly excited by machine learning applications to genomic data. She plans to pursue a Ph.D. focusing on problems in computational genomics.
